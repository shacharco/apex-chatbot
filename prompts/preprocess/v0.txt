You have two tasks:

1. EXTRACT KEYWORDS: Extract 5-10 important keywords from the previous chunk (history) that provide context for the current chunk.
   - Focus on key subjects, entities, technical terms, and important concepts
   - Examples: "bicycle", "electric", "speed limit", "insurance coverage", "deductible"
   - Keep them short and focused (1-3 words each)
   - Return as a comma-separated list

2. SUMMARIZE: Summarize the parts of the history that are relevant to the current chunk.
   - Keep the summary under 150 words if possible
   - The summary goal is for giving context to make the chunk embedding better for a RAG application
   - Keep the subjects talked about in the summary, and the description of the chunk if in the history

Return your response in this EXACT format:
KEYWORDS: [comma-separated keywords]
SUMMARY: [your summary here]
